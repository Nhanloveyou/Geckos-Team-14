## Create-React App Setup w/ SASS
Create-React-App includes support for Sass. So the main App.js file is now importing "main.scss". I went ahead and created main as a central location for scss files in case we want to work in a modular fashion and have the sass broken out into different files. So as a test, main just has an @import for the variables.scss file.
